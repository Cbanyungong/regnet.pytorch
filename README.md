# RegNet Implementation with TorchVision Style
PyTorch implementation of [Designing Network Design Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13678) by Ilija Radosavovic, Raj Prateek Kosaraju, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He, and Piotr Doll√°r.

Compared to the [official codebase](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pycls), this repo follows the [torchvision's ResNeXt](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/models/resnet.py) style, which is expected to be more easily interpredted and utilized by pre-existing downstream applications.

We have a plan to provide pre-trained models on ImageNet.
